    <h3>What is lexical scope</h3>
    <p>The code in one scope can access variable in same scope or any scope out of it.</p>

    <h3>What is an event loop in JavaScript ?</h3>
    <p>
        JavaScript is known for its ability to handle asynchronous task efficiently, even through it is single-threaded.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we say that javascript is single threaded , it means that javascript executes code one line at a time . in
        a sequence the main thread where all javascript code run can only do one task at a time and there is no way to
        run multiple pieces of code in parallel on this thread. this might sound limiting . but javascipt design is well
        suited for handling many tasks efficiently thanks to event loop
    </p>
    <h4>How do event loop work</h4>
    <p>Call stack</p>
    <p>javascipt uses a call stack to keep track of the currently executing function . it means where the program is in
        its execution</p>
    <p>Callback Queue</p>
    <p>Asynchronous operations , such as I/O operations or timers are handled by the browser or node js runtime . When
        these operations are complete. corresponding functions (callback) are placed in the callback queue</p>
    <p>Event loop</p>
    <p>The event loop continously checks the call stack and the callback queue if the callstack is empty . it takes the
        first function from the calback queue and push it to call stack for execution</p>
    <p>Execution</p>
    <p>The function on top of call stack is executed. if this function contains asynchronous code, it might initiate
        further asynchronous operations </p>

    <p>Callback execution</p>
    <p>When an asynchronous operation is complate , its callback is placed in the callback queue</p>

    <p>Repeat</p>
    <p>The event loop continues this process, ensuring that the callstack is alwas empty before taking the next function
        from the callback queue</p>

    <h4>Event bubbling in JavaScript</h4>
    <p>Event bubbling is a method in javascript of event propogation in the HTMl DOM where an event triggered in an
        element inside another element bubbles up through the hierarchy. When both the inner and outer element have
        event listener registered for the same event, event bubbling ensures the event is first handled by the innermost
        element and then propogated outward to the containing element.</p>
