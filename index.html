    <h3>What is lexical scope</h3>
    <p>The code in one scope can access variable in same scope or any scope out of it.</p>

    <h3>What is an event loop in JavaScript ?</h3>
    <p>
        JavaScript is known for its ability to handle asynchronous task efficiently, even through it is single-threaded.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we say that javascript is single threaded , it means that javascript executes code one line at a time . in
        a sequence the main thread where all javascript code run can only do one task at a time and there is no way to
        run multiple pieces of code in parallel on this thread. this might sound limiting . but javascipt design is well
        suited for handling many tasks efficiently thanks to event loop
    </p>
    <h4>How do event loop work</h4>
    <p>Call stack</p>
    <p>javascipt uses a call stack to keep track of the currently executing function . it means where the program is in
        its execution</p>
    <p>Callback Queue</p>
    <p>Asynchronous operations , such as I/O operations or timers are handled by the browser or node js runtime . When
        these operations are complete. corresponding functions (callback) are placed in the callback queue</p>
    <p>Event loop</p>
    <p>The event loop continously checks the call stack and the callback queue if the callstack is empty . it takes the
        first function from the calback queue and push it to call stack for execution</p>
    <p>Execution</p>
    <p>The function on top of call stack is executed. if this function contains asynchronous code, it might initiate
        further asynchronous operations </p>

    <p>Callback execution</p>
    <p>When an asynchronous operation is complate , its callback is placed in the callback queue</p>

    <p>Repeat</p>
    <p>The event loop continues this process, ensuring that the callstack is alwas empty before taking the next function
        from the callback queue</p>

    <h4>Event bubbling in JavaScript</h4>
    <p>Event bubbling is a method in javascript of event propogation in the HTMl DOM where an event triggered in an
        element inside another element bubbles up through the hierarchy. When both the inner and outer element have
        event listener registered for the same event, event bubbling ensures the event is first handled by the innermost
        element and then propogated outward to the containing element.</p>

    <p>Event bubbling is a type of event propagation in which an event triggered on a child elemnet "bubbles up" through
        its parent element . the event start from the target element and then moves up to the root element of the DOM
    </p>

    <h3>Event trigger</h3>
    <p>When and event (Like click) happens on a child element , the event first triggers at the target element </p>
    <h3>Propagation</h3>
    <p>After the target elemnent processes the event , the event is then passed to the parent element and continues
        moving up to the root</p>
    <h3>Bubble phase</h3>
    <p>The event can be intercepted and handled at any of the parent elements along the path</p>
    <div id="parent">
        <button id="child">Click Me</button>
    </div>
    <h3>Event Delegation</h3>
    <p>Event delegation is a technique in which a single event listener is added to a parent element to handle events that occurs on its child elements even if those child elements are added later dynamically. This reduces the need to attach event listeners to each child individually</p>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Single Listener</p>
    <p>Instead of adding listeners to each child element, you add a listener to a parent eleemnt that will listen for eventscoming from any of its descendants.</p>
    <p>Event handling</p>
    <p>When the event bubbles up to the parent the event listener on the parent can determine which child element triggered the event by inspacting the event.targer</p>
    <p>Dynamic Elements</p>
    <p>Event Delegation is useful for handling events for handling events on dynamically added eleemnts that doesnot exists when the page is first loaded</p>

    <h3>Void element in html</h3>
    <p>Void element in html are that do not have any content or closing tags . These elements are also known as self closing elemnets, as they are automatically closed by the browser. They represents an empty structure and are offen used </p>
